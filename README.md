###      📚 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING STUDENT 📚


🦾 I'm passionate about programming and currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I'm in my sixth semester and putting in a lot of effort to master Python and Django, with the goal of contributing to exciting projects as a backend developer. Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, which helps me build a well-rounded skill set.


🌎 With over four years of experience in the BPO industry as a bilingual customer service representative, I've developed strong communication and problem-solving skills. Now, I'm excited to take the next step in my career and transition into development, where I can apply my technical knowledge and continue to grow as a developer. 🚅
